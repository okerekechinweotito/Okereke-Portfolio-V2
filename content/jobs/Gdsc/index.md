GDSC - Google Developer Student Club

- I helped prepare Students in my School for Job roles as Software Developers. This is achieved with corporation from our Schools Academia on one end, and Google developers on the other providing technical resources and support.
- I also participated in Community Outreach programs where we encouraged students to develop their tech skills
